# unityscripts
A custom library of scripts that can be configured from the inspector.

## Overview
This repository collects small Unity scripts that can be easily integrated into your project. Every script exposes fields in the Unity Inspector, making it simple to adjust behavior without diving into code.

### Example features
- Basic movement and rotation helpers
- Utility functions for referencing game objects
- Common gameplay patterns for rapid prototyping
- Plug-and-play audio and scene utilities
## Essential Scripts
The `EssentialScripts` folder contains quick-drop components for common tasks like audio volume control and scene loading.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or copy the scripts you need.
2. Drop the scripts into your Unity project's **Assets** folder.
3. Attach a script component to a GameObject.
4. Tweak its fields in the Inspector to see immediate changes.

## Memes
Because no README is complete without a little fun:

> It's dangerous to go alone! Take this script.

Keep calm and code on.
