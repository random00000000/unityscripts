# unityscripts
A custom library of scripts that can be configured from the inspector.

## Overview
This repository collects small Unity scripts that can be easily integrated into your project. Every script exposes fields in the Unity Inspector, making it simple to adjust behavior without diving into code.

### Example features

- Common gameplay patterns for rapid prototyping
- Plug-and-play audio and scene utilities
- Push-to-talk voice chat
## Essential Scripts
The `EssentialScripts` folder contains quick-drop components for common tasks like audio volume control and scene loading.

## Networking
Scripts related to multiplayer features live in the `Networking` folder. The `FishNet` subfolder includes components specifically for the FishNet networking library.

## Usage
1. Download the individual scripts you want from this repository.
2. Drop the scripts into your Unity project's **Assets** folder.
3. Attach a script component to a GameObject.
4. Tweak its fields in the Inspector to see immediate changes.
